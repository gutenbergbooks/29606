<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<p>This <span class='smcap'>Poem</span> was written under the circumstances
which its title implies. Three years since, as the author
was descending the Ohio, to become a citizen of
the West, he wrote a considerable number of stanzas,
expressive of his feelings, six or eight of which were
published as a fragment on his arrival in Cincinnati,
in the Commercial Daily Advertiser, and republished
and noticed by different prints in a way that induced
the author, from time to time, to add stanzas to stanzas,
until they almost imperceptibly reached their
present number. He wrote on, without any previous
study of the style or manner in which the subject
should be pursued&ndash;&ndash;using the poetic license of light
and shade as Fancy dictated. Being in ill health, and
coming to a strange land, it was very natural for his
Reflections to be of a sombre cast, without there being
any thing peculiar in his situation differing from
that of other Emigrants.</p>
<p>The reader will perceive that the metrical arrangement
of the stanzas is the same as that used by Gray,
in his Ode to Adversity, with this difference, that the
Ode is written in lines of eight syllables, and the author
has attempted the heroic measure.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_iv' name='page_iv'></a>iv</span></div>
<p>After the <span class='smcap'>Poem</span> had been finished some time, the
author delivered it in the Hall of the Lyceum to an
assemblage of Ladies and Gentlemen. Their reception
and that of the several editors (to whom he is
most grateful) who noticed its delivery, and gave extracts
from the <span class='smcap'>Poem</span>, induced him to publish it.</p>
<p>The author has by him many manuscript pieces
with which he might have swelled the volume to a
much greater size; but as this is his first attempt at
authorship, in the shape of a volume, he offers it,
tremblingly, at the ordeal of public opinion, merely
as a sample of his ware.</p>

first encouragement which I received, for this my first
literary attempt of any length, proceeded from yourself;
if it has merit, I know no one to whom I should
more properly inscribe it than to the one, who being
entitled to speak <i>ex cathedra</i> on the subject, first cheered
me with the hope of its success. And if it shall be
found to be destitute of merit, while it shows that
your judgment has for once been wrong, it will also
prove that the error proceeded from a personal partiality,
for which I am anxious to express my gratitude.</p>

<h2>MEMOIR.</h2>
</div>
<p>Frederick William Thomas was the oldest child of E.
S. Thomas and Anna his wife. He was born at Providence
Rhode Island, but spent his earlier years at Charleston
South Carolina, where Mr. E. S. Thomas resided
and edited and published the Charleston City Gazette.</p>
<p>While Frederick William was still young, Mr. Thomas
removed to Baltimore Maryland, and there his son was
educated and brought up to the profession of the law.
Being unfortunate in business, when Frederick William
was about nineteen, Mr. Thomas resolved to remove with
his family to the west, which he did, making Cincinnati
his place of residence. His son however, remained in
Baltimore.</p>
<p>It was in the following year while journeying West,
to join his family in their new home, that this poem&ndash;&ndash;the
Emigrant was suggested to him, by the associations and the
romantic scenery of the Ohio river, and while descending
it most, if not all the poem, was written. He was about
twenty-one when it appeared. It was followed by &#8220;Clinton
Bradshaw,&#8221; or the adventures of a Lawyer, published by
Carey, Lee and Blanchard, of Philadelphia. This was
called the best American Novel of its time. Mr. Thomas&#8217;
next venture was &#8220;East and West&#8221; which was succeeded
by &#8220;Howard Pinkney.&#8221; During the years which intervened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_viii' name='page_viii'></a>viii</span>
between the writing of these books he resided in the
west, principally in Cincinnati, and wrote tales, sketches,
fugitive poetry, delivered lectures, and made political
speeches. In 1840 when General Harrison was elected
President, Mr. Thomas went to Washington City. After
General Harrison&#8217;s death, Mr. Tyler gave him an office
under government and he continued to reside at the Capital,
but wrote little except an occasional song or story.
Some years elapsed and Mr. Thomas left Washington and
went south on a lecturing tour. He was engaged to write
for several newspapers and continued lecturing through
the South and West. His literary efforts at this period
were chiefly confined to Magazine articles, short poems
and songs. His song &#8220;T&#8217;is said that Absence conquers
Love,&#8221; was one of the most popular of the day. He often
spoke of the feeling he had in passing of a summers night
through a strange city and having his own words greet
him from houses whose inmates only knew of his existence
through them.</p>
<p>Clinton Bradshaw was also very popular. An American
visiting Calcutta India, wrote home of the thrill it
gave him to find it on the shelves of a book store there.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas was popular in society for he was
amiable and entertaining. He was a fine belle letter
scholar, and was remarkable for his conversationable powers&ndash;&ndash;he
had a fund of anecdote always at command. He
was a great observer and studier of Character and a believer
in human nature.</p>
<p>The year 1866 found him again in Washington city
where after a short illness he died. Recently his remains
have been brought to Cincinnati, by his brother Calvin W.
Thomas and placed beside those of his parents in Spring
Grove Cemetery.</p>

<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Then came reality,&ndash;&ndash;the heart-spring froze:&ndash;&ndash;<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>There was the stream, the willow, and the wild wood,<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Where, emulous of height, in playing childhood,<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>With hearts encircled, on the beechen tree,<br />

<p class='cg'><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>How deep the bitterness alone to grieve<br />

<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Not as a portion, but the whole of fate,<br />

<p class='center'><i>&#8220;The Emigrant, or Reflections,&#8221; &amp;c.</i></p>
<p>Mr. Hammond, in the notice which he was so kind as to take of this <span class='smcap'>Poem</span>,
suggested the alteration of the title from &#8220;Reflections&#8221; to &#8220;Reveries.&#8221; In
retaining the first title, I do not do so because I think it best, but merely
because it was the first title, and the one under which the extracts were
given.</p>
<p>It seems to the author, if he may dare to hazard the remark, that the stanza
in which he has attempted to write, has advantages over even the Spenserean
stanzas. He understands the latter to be that in which the Fairy
Queen, from whose author it takes its name&ndash;&ndash;Beattie&#8217;s Minstrel, Thompson&#8217;s
Castle of Indolence, Byron&#8217;s Childe Harold, &amp;c. &amp;c., are written.
The following is a stanza of it, from Childe Harold:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>The starry fable of the Milky Way<br />
Has not thy story&#8217;s purity; it is<br />
A constellation of a sweeter ray,<br />
And sacred nature triumphs more in this<br />
Reverse of her decree, than in the abyss<br />
Where sparkle distant worlds. Oh! holiest nurse!<br />
No drop of that clear spring its way shall miss<br />
To thy sire&#8217;s heart, replenishing its source<br />
With life, as our free souls rejoin the Universe.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Here, the reader will perceive that, in a stanza of nine lines, there is a
necessity for the second, the fourth, the fifth, and the seventh lines to
rhyme together; and that the sixth, eighth and ninth lines must, also,
rhyme together. To make the stanza correct, with these complicated embarrassments
of rhyme, must not only cause great trouble, sometimes, to
the easiest versifier, but to succeed in doing so, critically, he must often
sacrifice a happy expression, a striking phrase, or a beautiful line. &#8220;Words
are things,&#8221; says Mirabeau; and, to the poet, they are things of potency.
They are at once tools and materials in his headwork.</p>
<p>Any one who has read Childe Harold, must have observed that even the
Lord of Poets, with all his powers of language, was often thus hampered,
and that, for the sake of preserving the force of an expression, or a striking
word, he used what are no rhymes at all, if Monk Lewis&#8217; remark to
Scott, &#8220;that a bad rhyme is no rhyme,&#8221; be true.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></div>
<p>Whereas, by making the stanza of but eight lines and having the first
four lines to rhyme alternately, and the last four immediately, and by
having the concluding line an Alexandrine, as in the Spenserean stanzas,
the difficulty, arising from the necessity of having so many similar
rhymes, would be obviated, and the poet would have much greater facilities
in expressing himself well, without impairing the dignity or strength
of what might still be called, from its many resemblances, the Spenserean
stanzas; at the same time, the monotony would be avoided, of which criticism
has complained so much in the works of Pope and Goldsmith.</p>
<p>Very few readers of poetry, in the first poems which they open, are fond
of those, no matter how great their merits, which are written in the Spenserean
stanzas. They have to acquire a taste for it. They delight in
simpler styles: this is one reason of Scott&#8217;s great popularity with many
persons who seldom read any other poet, except perhaps, Burns. And
even to those who have a natural taste for poetry, but who have not much
cultivated it, the Spenserean stanza seems complicated, and, I will even
venture to say, at first untunable; and it is not at the first perusal that
they perceive the beauties of those poems which are written in this style.</p>
<p>These remarks are hazarded very hastily. It would be much more
difficult for the author to build the complicated verse of the Spenserean
stanza, than this which he has attempted; and, therefore, perhaps, very
rashly, he concludes that it would be more difficult for others; and, moreover,
we easily persuade ourselves that what is most easily done it is best
to do.</p>

<p class='cg'><i>&#8220;Here once Boone trod&ndash;&ndash;the hardy Pioneer&ndash;&ndash;<br />
The only white man in the wilderness.&#8221;</i></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>In a late work entitled &#8220;Sketches of Western Adventure,&#8221; a most
interesting account is given of Boone, whose passion for a sylvan life was
intense. Like Leather-stocking, it would seem that he always got lost in
the clearing, and that only in the forest he knew his way and felt free
and unincumbered. Then, like McGregor, &#8220;standing on his native heath,&#8221;
he feared no difficulties or dangers. Byron, in his Don Juan, calls him
&#8220;The man of Ross run wild,&#8221; and says, that he &#8220;killed nothing but a
bear or buck,&#8221; but not so; he had many deadly encounters with the Indians,
and was repeatedly taken prisoner by them; but he effected his
escapes with great tact. The author of &#8220;Sketches of Western Adventure,&#8221;
speaking of him, alone in the wilderness, says,</p>
<p>&#8220;The wild and solitary grandeur of the country around him, where not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
a tree had been cut, nor a house erected, was to him an inexhaustible
source of admiration and delight; and he says himself, that some of the
most rapturous moments of his life were spent in those lonely rambles.
The utmost caution was necessary to avoid the savages, and scarcely less
to escape the ravenous hunger of the wolves that prowled nightly around
him in immense numbers. He was compelled frequently to shift his lodging,
and by undoubted signs, saw that the Indians had repeatedly visited
his hut during his absence. He sometimes lay in canebrakes, without
fire, and heard the yells of the Indians around him. Fortunately, however,
he never encountered them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. John A. McClung is the author of the above mentioned work. This
gentleman is also the author of a novel, entitled &#8220;Camden,&#8221; which has
not received half the notice it deserved.</p>
<p>Mr. Flint has now in the press a life of Boone, which will soon be published.
I am indebted to him for the following graphic note, concerning
Boone:</p>
<p>&#8220;This extraordinary man, whose birth is said to have been in Maryland,
in Virginia, and in North Carolina, was in fact born in neither; but
in Pennsylvania, in Buck&#8217;s County, about twenty miles from Philadelphia.
When he was three years old, his father removed to a water of the
Schuylkill, not far from Reading. When he was thirteen years old, his
father removed thence to the South <a name='TC_6'></a><ins title="Changed period to comma">Yadkin,</ins> North Carolina; and in the
midst of the bushy hills of that State the character of this Nimrod was
developed.</p>
<p><a name='TC_7'></a><ins title="Added quote">&#8220;No</ins> historical facts are better attested, than those, to which allusion is
here made. The native sagacity, the robust hardihood, the invincible
courage and spirit of endurance, put forth on all occasions by the pioneer
of Kentucky, were, perhaps, never surpassed by any character on record.
These traits were admirably balanced and relieved by a disposition
peculiarly mild and gentle. In his old age he removed from Kentucky to
the banks of the Missouri. The portrait of him in the capitol is said not
to be a correct likeness. He was of the middle stature, of prodigious
strength and swiftness, with sandy hair, and a bright complexion, a bold,
prominent forehead, aquiline nose and compressed lips. There was a
peculiar brightness, an unquenchable elasticity and force visible in his
forehead and his eye, even under the frost of eighty winters. His old age
was not cheered by affluence, but his departure was neither unhonored, nor
unsung. No American character seems to have more chained interest
and attention. His life constitutes the theme of Mr. Bryant&#8217;s &#8216;Mountain
Muse,&#8217; and he is one among the few, whom lord Byron honored with unalloyed
eulogy, in seven or eight of the happiest stanzas of Don Juan.&#8221;</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>Kentucky was called the &#8220;dark and bloody ground&#8221; by the Indians, in
consequence of many of the fiercest contests having occurred there; it
was the common hunting ground of many of the tribes, and here they
frequently met in their excursions, scarcely ever without bloodshed.</p>
<p>At my request, I was kindly furnished with the annexed note by Judge
Hall, on the subject of Indian mounds, which should have been inserted
under the passage which alludes to them; but the reference at the proper
place being accidentally omitted, it is given here. Judge Hall will readily
imagine why the author has omitted some passages of the note, which to
himself were not the least pleasing.</p>
<p>This gentleman has lately become a citizen of Cincinnati, where those,
who knew him formerly but by his high reputation, now feel how much
courtesy and kindness increase its charm.</p>
<p>Judge Hall is of opinion that most of the mounds are natural; speaking
of them he says:</p>
<p>&#8220;There are few objects so well calculated to strike the poetic imagination
as these mounds, standing alone in the wilderness. The belief that
they are the workmanship of human hands, awakens curiosity and leads
to a long train of reflections. For if men have thrown up these singular
elevations, we feel inquisitive to know by whom, and for what purpose,
they were erected. They are large and numerous; and they bear every
mark of great antiquity. Indeed, I am of opinion, that they are as old as
the hills.</p>
<p><a name='TC_8'></a><ins title="Added quote">&#8220;Supposing</ins> them to be artificial, we are led into a vast field of conjecture.
Were they made by the present race of savages, who are ignorant of all
the mechanic arts, and disinclined to labor? If so, what inducement
could have been placed before them, sufficiently powerful, to break down the
barriers of nature, and bring men habitually indolent, to so herculean
a task? The Indian, as we see him now, never works. He is the sovereign
of the woods, and strides over his heritage with the step of a master,
and the wild glance of one who disdains employment. He submits to no
restraint but that of military discipline.</p>
<p><a name='TC_9'></a><ins title="Added quote">&#8220;Viewing</ins> them as artificial, nothing can be more curious; and whether
we suppose them to have been graves, or temples, or fortifications, they
are equally calculated to awaken feelings of wonder, if not of awe. We
see them in the wilderness, where, for ages, savage men alone have dwelt,
and we behold them covered with majestic oaks, which have flourished for
centuries. They have existed here in the silence and repose of the forest,
unchanged amid the revolutions which have been carried on around them.
They are among the few records of the past. A people ignorant of writing,
painting, or sculpture, destitute of the mechanic arts, and without
any knowledge of the use of metals, have left few memorials; unless we
see them in the mounds, we might, perhaps, say none.</p>
<p><a name='TC_10'></a><ins title="Added quote">&#8220;If</ins> we suppose them to be natural, which, in my opinion, is the most
rational belief, as to the majority of the mounds, they are still attractive,
as natural curiosities, and as displaying a wonderful exhibition of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
creative power. Beheld in any light, they are interesting. Whatever
may have been their origin, they adorn the monotony of western scenery,
and afford employment to the fancy of the traveller. The plodding foot
may tread carelessly over them, the uninquiring eye may pass them, unheeded;
but the poet and philosopher linger around the hallowed spot
where they stand, to catch inspiration, or to gather wisdom from these
silent memorials.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judge Hall further says, &#8220;satisfied I am that if ever any rational hypothesis,
in relation to these interesting remains of past ages, shall be
invented, we shall owe it to the inspiration of the poet, and not to the
researches of the philosopher.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is very certain that no one can confront the traveller who may be
speculating upon these mounds, as Edie Ochiltree did the Antiquary, with
&#8220;I mind the bigging o&#8217; it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The allusion, here, is to Blennerhasset&#8217;s Island, which is beautifully
situated in the Ohio. The romantic story of its former inhabitants makes
it a spot of great interest to the Emigrant, who, in descending the river,
never fails to request that it may be pointed out to him; and it is often
the topic of conversation and conjecture to him and his companions for
hours after they have passed it. The author is indebted to Morgan Neville,
Esq., for the following account of the Island and its unfortunate
owner. Mr. Neville&#8217;s admirable tale of Mike Fink, and his other sketches,
have created in the public an appetite for more, which they have long
hoped he would be induced to gratify, with longer and more frequent
productions; or, at least, that he would collect what he has written into a
volume.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Blennerhasset&#8217;s Island.</span>&ndash;&ndash;How many recollections of mingled pleasure
and pain, does the name of this once beautiful spot, call to mind! In
descending the Ohio, I never come in sight of the Island, without sensations
almost too powerful to bear; and I linger on the deck of the boat,
until the point below snatches it from view. The first impressions were
made on me in early youth, and time cannot efface them; on the contrary,
the long vista through which I look back to this western <a name='TC_11'></a><ins title="Changed to single quotes">&#8216;Eden,&#8217;</ins>
presents it, probably, with exaggerated colorings of beauty and loveliness.
The traveller, as he wanders over the grounds, once consecrated by
philanthropy, cannot reconcile it with probability, that a proud mansion,
a quarter of a century since, was here erected, dedicated to hospitality,
where a priestess, in the person of an elegant and refined lady, shed an
influence around that attracted to its portal the stranger from every
country. In looking at a scene, now desolate and repulsive, he can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
scarcely credit the fact, that, within that period, the same place was
embellished by gardens, groves, and arbors, upon which taste was exhausted,
and which cost a fortune to realize. The villa of Blennerhasset
was really a beacon-light in the wilderness, that seemed created to invite
the approach of the stranger to enjoy that repose which the sluggish and
comfortless mode of travelling of that day, rendered so gratifying. The
only sounds now heard, are the sighing of the wind through the lofty
cotton wood, or the puffing of steam, as some boat rushes rapidly past the
prosperous settlement of Bellepre. There was a time when music of a
less melancholy character breathed upon the ear; when a master hand
swept the chords, and science and taste directed the scene.</p>
<p>Herman Blennerhasset and his accomplished wife have sat for many a
picture; but, after all, Fancy, alone, guided the pencil, and the originals
have never been truly sketched. The reality of their history possesses
sufficient interest, without the aid of fiction, to enlist the sympathies of
the most romantic. Born to fortune, and nobly connected, Blennerhasset
stood in the front rank of Irish society. Educated for the bar, he distinguished
himself on many occasions, and he was the assistant counsel, with
Curran, in the celebrated trial of Hamilton Rowan. But his disposition
was restless, his mind visionary, and, doubtless, he felt sincerely for the
degraded state of his country. Notwithstanding his close relationship to
the aristocracy of Ireland, and the glaring unfitness of his character for
scenes of daring and of danger, he connected himself with the leading
yeomen of that day, and became the intimate associate and co-adjutor of
Arthur O&#8217;Conner. He continued to labor in the cause of Liberty, until
the eyes of Government were turned upon him; the result is a matter of
public history: O&#8217;Conner was arrested, and Blennerhasset escaped. He
had the good fortune, however, to secure a considerable portion of his
property, and, accompanied by his accomplished wife, an English lady, he
arrived in New York <a name='TC_12'></a><ins title="Was 'iu'">in</ins> 1796 or &#8217;97, with what, in this country, was
esteemed a large fortune.</p>
<p>He was, however, a visionary; he knew nothing of human nature,
nothing of the practical business of life. With considerable literary
acquirements, and much pretensions to science, he gave himself up to all
the reveries and schemes of modern philosophy; with Southey, Godwin,
and the whole class, he was continually dreaming about the perfectibility
of human nature, and believed that innocence was alone to be found in
that portion of humanity, which approached the nearest to the state of
nature. With these notions, which he succeeded, in some measure, in
imparting to his young and interesting partner, he declined establishing
himself in any of our Atlantic cities, then the only places in the Union
offering attractions to a foreigner of taste and fortune, and turned his
attention, to the magnificent solitudes of the West. He purchased a portion
of the Island in Virginia, near the mouth of the Little Kenhawa,
which has been consecrated by his misfortunes, and executed those embellishments
which have since become the theme of many a fanciful
speech and tale.</p>
<p>Considering himself a second Capac, he set about acquiring an influence
over the rude inhabitants of the Virginia shores, which might enable him
to test the efficiency of his favorite system. But his exertions were abortive,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
and he became convinced of the folly of his early speculations on
human nature; his unsophisticated scholars, affecting to admire him,
overreached him on all occasions, and then laughed at him. He embarked
in commercial speculations; this proved a failure, and he stopped in time
to save a portion of the large fortune which, a few years before, he brought
from Europe. He recanted, in bitterness of feeling, his early political
principles, and began to sigh for the charms of refined society. Discontent
stole into his domestic circle, and the idea of educating his two interesting
boys in the desert became insupportable.</p>

<p>During this state of feeling, Colonel Burr presented himself, armed
with all the fascinations of manners and address, which so eminently
distinguished him. He soon became the ruler of the destiny of the
Island pair, and unfolded to them, with resistless eloquence, his magnificent
project of the conquest of Mexico, gilding his own ambition under
the plausible motive of relieving enslaved millions from the thraldom of
Spanish tyranny. The idea of becoming prominent members of a court
that would rival the ancient splendor of Montezuma, and the modern
glory of Napoleon, absorbed every other feeling. The remains of this
once large fortune were embarked in the scheme, and ruin and misery
were the consequence. What he felt and saw as but a misdemeanor, was
distorted, by political rancor, into treason; and, although one of the most
enlightened juries that were ever empanelled, pronounced an acquittal,
Blennerhasset was left destitute of means, and blasted in reputation. He
attempted to retrieve his affairs as a cotton planter, but was unsuccessful;
he afterwards removed to Montreal, to resume his profession. Within a
few years he has returned to England, the outlawry against him having
been removed; and those who feel an interest in the history of this persecuted
family, may be gratified to know that their decline of life will not
be devoid of comfort. They reside near Bath, in England, with a sister of
Blennerhasset, the relict of the late admiral De Courcy. The evening of
life promises to close free from those clouds that so long lowered over
them.</p>
